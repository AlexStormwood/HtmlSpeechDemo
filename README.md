# HTML Speech Demo
 Experiments with the SpeechSynthesis API.

 When the page loads, no voices are loaded beyond the default system voice.

 You can click on the "Get device voices" button to find any speech synthesis voices available on your device.

 When a list of voices is available, you can use the dropdown list to change the currently-active voice.
